# EPJA-Course

This project is Enterprise Programming on Javascript - Advanced course project.

## Project Description

Searching on recipes given some keyword, using Spoonacular api, you can also check besides the description/recipe, the ingredients.

Maybe as an addition, another api that would use to create/generate list of groceries given the food title(then the recipe using spoonacular would be used), and given number of people that would eat).
